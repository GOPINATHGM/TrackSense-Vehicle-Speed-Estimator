## üß∞ Tech Stack

| Tool / Library | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| Python | Main programming language |
| OpenCV | Video processing and frame capture |
| NumPy | Math operations and distance calculation |
| YOLOv3 | Object detection framework |
| COCO Dataset | Pre-trained model labels for vehicles |
| Deque (collections) | Efficient position tracking over frames |

## üß† How It Works

1. **Video Input**: Loads traffic video.
2. **Object Detection**: YOLOv3 detects vehicles (cars, trucks, etc.).
3. **Tracking**: Tracks vehicle center points across frames.
4. **Speed Calculation**: Measures displacement over time (pixels to meters).
5. **Resonance Estimation**: Speed √ó Vehicle-type factor.
6. **Alert**: If resonance exceeds a threshold, a notification is printed.
